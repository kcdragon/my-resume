\section{Mongration}
Mongration (\url{https://github.com/kcdragon/mongration}) is an open source database migration tool for MongoDB. It is designed to be included as a Gem in any Ruby project. I developed Mongration while working with MongoDB and realizing I still had a need for migrations. MongoDB does not require migrations for schema changes however there are still times when you need to change field names, create lookup tables, etc. and having a standardized way of doing it proved invaluable. Mongration has the same interface as ActiveRecord migrations so it fits in nicely with other Gems that make use of ActiveRecordâ€™s Rake tasks (like deploying with Capistrano).

\section{JRuby Contributions}
After seeing a couple talks on JRuby at the most recent RubyConf, I was inspired to send some pull requests to JRuby. Here are links to the pull requests I made for implementing the \verb|empty?| method on \verb|File|, \verb|Dir| and \verb|Pathname|.

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|File.empty?| \url{https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/4296}
\item \verb|Dir.empty?| \url{https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/4301}
\item \verb|Pathname#empty?| \url{https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/4322}
\end{itemize}

In addition to the code in the pull requests, I think that the descriptions and comments will give you some insight into my thought process as a developer.

\section{Blog Post on Functional Programming}
See \url{http://www.weblinc.com/labs/functional-programming-discounts/}. This not strictly a code sample but it does present some of my thoughts on functional programming so I thought it would be a good example of my work.
